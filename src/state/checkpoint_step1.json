    "Found 26 distinct adjustable variables across standalone and network models",
    "Only 8 variables currently have UI controls despite 13 being scenario-dependent",
    "Identified 3 naming collisions: adoption rate terminology, transaction naming, retailer-specific prefixes",
    "Royalty Margin (95%) is adjustable but only affects one KPI (EBIT per Customer) - minimal impact",
    "Several high-impact variables are fixed: minting fee ($0.10), active consent (80-85%), total customers (120M)",
    "Network Effects tab has 11 per-retailer config variables but only 4 are exposed in UI",
    "License Fee and Reuse Rate vary significantly across Low/Base/High scenarios - not just adoption/volume"

  "open_questions": [
    "Which variables should be live-adjustable in a Walmart pitch vs. internal-only?",
    "Should pricing variables (license fee, minting fee) be exposed or kept confidential?",
    "Is Royalty Margin strategically valuable to show, or does it reveal internal margin structure?",
    "Do Launch Month parameters telegraph roadmap timing in a way that sets wrong expectations?",
    "Is Network Coefficient (Metcalfe k-value) too technical for C-suite audience?"
