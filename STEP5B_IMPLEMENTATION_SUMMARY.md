# Step 5b Implementation Summary: KPI Consistency & Tooltip Layer

## Implementation Date
October 29, 2025

## Changes Completed

### TASK 1: Network Lift Calculation Fix (App.jsx)
**Location**: Lines 664-687

**Changes**:
- Network Lift now uses true 36-month cumulative revenue comparison
- Uses `cumulativeRetailer` (standalone) vs `displayCumulativeRetailer` (network)
- Calculation performed once at top level, rounded to 1 decimal place
- Stored in `results.networkLiftDisplayPercent` for KpiStrip

**Key Variables**:
```javascript
const standaloneCumulativeRevenue = cumulativeRetailer;
const networkCumulativeRevenue = displayCumulativeRetailer;
const networkLiftRaw = ((networkCumulativeRevenue - standaloneCumulativeRevenue) / standaloneCumulativeRevenue) * 100;
const networkLiftDisplayPercent = parseFloat(networkLiftRaw.toFixed(1));
```

### TASK 2: KpiStrip Calculation Corrections (KpiStrip.jsx)
**Location**: Entire component rewrite

**Changes**:
- EBIT Margin now correctly calculated as `(walmartEbit / walmartRevenue) * 100`
- No longer assumes `royaltyMargin` is the margin
- Consumer Dividend calculated as `consumerEarnings / optedInCustomers`
- Network Lift shows `"—"` when `showNetworkEffects` is false

**Props Updated**:
- `subtitle` (previously `subtext`)
- `baseline` (previously split between `benchmark` and `showBenchmark`)
- `tooltip` (now simple string, not object)

### TASK 3: Executive-Grade Tooltips (KpiMetric.jsx)
**Location**: Complete component simplification

**Changes**:
- Removed complex hover state and tooltip overlay
- Now uses native HTML `title` attribute on ⓘ icon
- Tooltips appear inline next to KPI title

**Tooltip Content**:
- **EBIT Margin**: "EBIT Margin is Walmart's profit after bank payouts, compliance overhead, data-agent fees, and platform costs. This is fully incremental to Walmart Connect."
- **Consumer Dividend**: "Average annual cash-like value a consenting shopper earns by letting Walmart license their purchase history. This creates loyalty and higher spend per household."
- **Network Lift**: "Revenue upside Walmart gets by joining a multi-retailer network. Brands pay more when they can see cross-retailer performance. This is Walmart's incremental gain, not Target's revenue."

### TASK 4: Cost Structure Slider Validation (ConfigurationFlyout.jsx)
**Location**: Lines 770-880 (Advanced Settings section)

**Changes**:
- Added section intro: "These are Walmart's ongoing operating costs to run the program. They're already deducted when we show EBIT Margin."
- Converted to data-driven array with slider configs
- Added `clamp()` function to prevent out-of-range values
- Added help text under each slider

**Slider Definitions**:
```javascript
[
  { id: "bankShare", label: "Bank Share", min: 0.00, max: 0.05, 
    help: "Share paid to issuing bank / payments infrastructure." },
  { id: "dataAgentShare", label: "Data Agent Share", min: 0.00, max: 0.05,
    help: "Compliance + consent agent costs to manage user permissions." },
  { id: "platformFee", label: "Platform Fee", min: 0.00, max: 0.10,
    help: "Technology + ops cost to run the marketplace." },
  { id: "sgaOverhead", label: "SG&A Overhead", min: 0.00, max: 0.10,
    help: "Sales, marketing, admin support for scaling the program." }
]
```

### TASK 5: Visual Polish
**Completed**:
- Network Lift displays `"—"` when effects are off
- Baseline "Baseline: 0%" still shows when effects are off
- Tooltip ⓘ icon present on all three KPIs
- Font consistency maintained (Inter family)
- No gradients added to KPI cards (kept flat design)

## Smoke Test Checklist

### Test 1: Network Effects OFF
- [ ] Load Executive Summary tab
- [ ] Verify EBIT Margin shows reasonable % (70-85% range)
- [ ] Verify Consumer Dividend shows dollar amount (e.g., "$48")
- [ ] Verify Network Lift shows "—" (em dash, not zero)
- [ ] Verify baseline text shows "Baseline: 0%" under Network Lift
- [ ] Hover over ⓘ icons to confirm tooltips appear

### Test 2: Network Effects ON
- [ ] Toggle "Show Network Effects" switch
- [ ] Verify Network Lift now shows "+X.X%" (e.g., "+10.3%")
- [ ] Verify the percentage matches cumulative revenue delta
- [ ] Verify EBIT Margin updates if costs changed
- [ ] Verify Consumer Dividend reflects network multiplier

### Test 3: Configuration Flyout - Cost Structure
- [ ] Click ⚙ Configuration button
- [ ] Expand "Advanced" section
- [ ] Locate "Cost Structure" section
- [ ] Verify section intro text appears above sliders
- [ ] Verify all 4 sliders render (Bank Share, Data Agent Share, Platform Fee, SG&A Overhead)
- [ ] Verify help text appears under each slider
- [ ] Drag each slider:
   - [ ] Bank Share (0-5%)
   - [ ] Data Agent Share (0-5%)
   - [ ] Platform Fee (0-10%)
   - [ ] SG&A Overhead (0-10%)
- [ ] Verify EBIT Margin in Executive Summary updates in real-time
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Verify Network Lift still displays correctly

### Test 4: Value Validation
- [ ] With Base scenario and Network Effects OFF:
   - Revenue should be ~36-month cumulative
   - EBIT Margin should be 80-85% (after 13% total costs)
   - Consumer Dividend should be $40-60 range
- [ ] With Base scenario and Network Effects ON:
   - Network Lift should show ~+9% to +11%
   - Should match: (Network Revenue - Standalone Revenue) / Standalone Revenue

### Test 5: Edge Cases
- [ ] Try setting all cost sliders to 0% - EBIT Margin should approach royaltyMargin (95%)
- [ ] Try setting all cost sliders to max - EBIT Margin should drop significantly
- [ ] Switch scenarios (Low/Base/High) - verify calculations remain consistent
- [ ] Enter Custom mode - verify cost sliders still work

## What's Next

**Step 6**: Remove in-tab scenario sliders to complete "single-source-of-truth" UX (all assumption editing lives in Configuration flyout).

## Notes for Walmart Pitch

**Key talking points now supported**:
1. EBIT Margin is real operating profit after all costs (not gross margin)
2. Consumer Dividend is actual per-customer annual value (builds trust)
3. Network Lift shows Walmart's incremental gain from network participation (not total network revenue)
4. Cost Structure is transparent and adjustable in real-time
5. All three KPIs have executive-grade explanations on hover

**Important clarifications**:
- Network Lift percentage is based on 36-month cumulative revenue comparison
- This is Walmart's revenue increase, not revenue from other retailers
- EBIT already includes all platform, bank, agent, and overhead costs
- Consumer Dividend creates loyalty flywheel (not a discount program)
